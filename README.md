# Prescription of convergence curves for weighted and preconditioned GMRES

This repository contains the Matlab scripts associated with the paper 

> *Any nonincreasing convergence curves are simultaneously possible for GMRES and weighted GMRES, as well as for left and right preconditioned GMRES*, P. Matalon, N. Spillane, 2025.

The scripts hold the implementation of the theorems' constructive proofs, and reproduce the numerical experiments. 

## Installation

Simply clone the repository.

Note that the Matlab package [krylov4r](https://github.com/hpc-maths/krylov4r) is used as a dependency. However, it is provided here, so all scripts can be run without any further installation.
